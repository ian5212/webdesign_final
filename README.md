As a part of the Fundamentals of Web Design class at NYU, students have to code and design an entire website from scratch using HTML, CSS, 
and Javascript elements to code the website and Figma to create wireframes and mockups. For my final project, I created a website for a fictional musical artist, me.

In total, this entire project took around 10 hours to complete. When I knew that I wanted to make an artist page, I came up with four albums and four different concepts 
for each album. I used AI to generate album and artist descriptions solely for the sake of time, and I even “created” each album by making 4 cohesive playlists on both 
Apple Music and Spotify. Fortunately, I had a picture that was in a similar aesthetic to the album ‘APOCRYPHA’, so I used it on the artist page.

After designing simple album covers for each album and “creating” the album themselves, I decided to make each page for each album different in its aesthetics. 
I ended up making around 10 logos in various fonts and colors depending on which website was being opened and created 5 different color palettes (main website, four albums) 
and font collections.

Each album cover also features a wide-length version of it, and a snippet of the album plays when the user clicks on the album cover on its own page (I grabbed the audio 
from a song on the playlist and cut it to be around 15-20 seconds long). Using VS Code to build the entire website, I was able to complete the project in less than 10 hours, which 
includes 7 webpages, 8 album covers, 10 logos, 4 audio snippets, and 8 playlists (4 on Apple Music and 4 on Spotify).
